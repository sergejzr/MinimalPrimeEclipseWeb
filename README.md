# MinimalPrimeEclipseWeb

You'd like to start with Java Web development with eclipse rightaway?

This repo will offer an Eclipse JSF project that uses maven and primefaces. 

Just check out the code and import into eclipse J2EE. 

You will need to install Tomcat 8.0 server and add the web app. Thats it.
